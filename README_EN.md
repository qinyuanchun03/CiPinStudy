**Xinhua Insight** is a client-side news intelligence dashboard designed to strip away the "positive energy" adjectives from official reports and reveal the underlying logic of policy, economy, and social control.

It combines real-time data crawling with Large Language Models (LLM) to act as your **"Deep Logic Decoder"**.

## 🛠 Technical Architecture & Crawling Logic

This project uses a **Client-Side Only** architecture. All data fetching, cleaning, storage, and analysis happen exclusively in your browser.

### 1. 🔍 The Crawler
Due to browser Same-Origin Policy (SOP), direct access to news sites is blocked. We use the following strategy:
*   **Target**: `https://m.news.cn/` (Mobile version, cleaner structure).
*   **Proxy**: Uses `AllOrigins` or similar public CORS proxies to bypass restrictions.
*   **Decoding**: Manually handles `ArrayBuffer` with `TextDecoder('utf-8')` to prevent encoding issues.

### 2. 🧹 Parsing
*   **DOM Parsing**: Uses the browser's native `DOMParser`.
*   **Selectors**: Targets `.headline`, `.swiper-slide`, and `.list li`.
*   **Date Extraction**: Extracts dates directly from the URL structure (e.g., `/2024-03/15/`) rather than relying on inconsistent on-page text.

### 3. 📊 Local NLP
*   **Tokenization**: Front-end based simple segmentation (N-gram).
*   **Stop Words**: Automatically removes bureaucratic filler words (e.g., "Strengthen", "Promote", "Important") to isolate high-value nouns (e.g., "Security", "Risk", "Struggle").

## ✨ Key Features

### 🤖 Multi-Perspective AI Decoding
We don't just summarize; we **interpret** through distinct personas:

| Persona | Role & Focus |
|---------|--------------|
| 🗣️ **Plain Spoken (Recommended)** | **The Truth-Teller.** Translates "Fiscal Policy" into "Watch your wallet". Synthesizes politics and economics into simple, actionable advice for the average family. |
| 🏃‍♂️ **Survivalist (Runxue)** | **The Alarmist.** Focuses on physical safety, border controls, supply chain shortages, and "Iron Fist" avoidance. |
| 📉 **Bear Economist** | **The Skeptic.** Looks past GDP growth to see local debt crises, tax enforcement risks, and currency devaluation. |
| 🕵️ **Political Observer** | **The Insider.** Analyzes personnel changes, meetings attended/absent, and ideological signaling (Zhongnanhai Watcher). |
| 🎓 **Exam Prep (Civil Service)** | **The Standard Answer.** Treats news as essay material and exam points. Analyzes hiring trends based on department power shifts. |

### 🔒 Privacy First
- **Zero Database**: All crawled data and API keys are stored in your browser's `LocalStorage`.
- **BYOK (Bring Your Own Key)**: Connects directly to OpenAI, DeepSeek, or a local Ollama instance running on your machine.

Click the **Settings (⚙️)** icon in the top right corner.

### 🔌 Scenario 1: Official Providers (Standard)
Directly connect to OpenAI or DeepSeek.
1. **Provider**: Select `OpenAI` or `DeepSeek`.
2. **API Key**: Enter your `sk-...` key.
3. **Model ID**: Enter the model name (e.g., `gpt-4o`, `deepseek-chat`).

### 🔌 Scenario 2: OpenAI-Compatible APIs (Custom)
For **Moonshot**, **Groq**, **OneAPI**, or other aggregators:
1. **Provider**: Select `OpenAI`.
2. **Base URL**: Change to your provider's API endpoint (e.g., `https://api.moonshot.cn/v1`).
3. **API Key**: Enter the provider's key.
4. **Model ID**: Enter the supported model ID.

### 🏠 Scenario 3: Local Privacy (Ollama)
Run offline with zero data leakage.
1. Ensure Ollama is running (`ollama serve`).
2. **Provider**: Select `Local Ollama`.
3. **Base URL**: Default is `http://localhost:11434`.
